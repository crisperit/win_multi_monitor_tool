## Introduction
Set of hotkeys & tools to make Windows multi monitor work much better

## [Functionalities](./release/README#functionalities)
## [Installation](./release/README#installation)

## Future plans
- Possibility to detect `Start` icon coordinates automatically (for now it requires it to be at bottom-left)
- Possiblity to detect `Task view` icon coordinates automatically (or not need it at all - there's Switch between windows shortcut)
- Find a way to calculate taskbar icon sizes - for now it is set to 45px which might not be always correct
- Part of windows are not moved due to lack of permissions - fix it
- RAIL_WINDOW window is not behaving correctly during movement
- Add possibility to setup some apps template for each monitor (so specific apps and their locations per window)
