## Future plans
- Possibility to detect `Start` icon coordinates automatically (for now it requires it to be at bottom-left)
- Possiblity to detect `Task view` icon coordinates automatically (or not need it at all - there's Switch between windows shortcut)
- Find a way to calculate taskbar icon sizes - for now it is set to 45px
- Part of windows are not moved due to lack of permissions - fix it
