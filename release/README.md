## Installation
For now the app was tested only on Windows 11 with 3 monitors (each 1920 x 1080 with 100% of scale)

1. The script also requires specific Windows taskbar setting (mostly because the script is clicking at specific regions...):
- Search : Hide
- Task view : On
- Widgets : Off
- Chat : Off
- Taskbar behaviors:
    - Taskbar alignment : Left
    - Automatically hide the taskbar : Unchecked
    - When using multiple displays, show my taskbar apps on : Taskbar where window is open

2. Download the content of `release` directory.
3. Run `multi_monitor_tool.exe` and test it out.

If more people will like to use that tool then we can work together to make it more flexible :D
